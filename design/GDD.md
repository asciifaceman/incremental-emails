# Core Concept
Emails.

At first you get very few, you must get yourself on more email blast lists and bump those numbers up.

Browse the web to fill out surveys and click banners to receive more spam email. 

As you get too many emails, they get archived into folders. A folder is worth 65,535 emails.

# An Email

Comprised of a Subject, and date received. Content doesn't matter since we never read them.

Your email account has a maxiumum storage of N emails. 

When you reach this limit, you must perform a reset of your account, which will cost money but will upgrade the maximum number of emails you can store and provide prestige points to upgrade various things, eventually introducing archive folders.

You can earn income by performing a few tasks that can eventually be automated, such as taking surveys where your rank can increase which raises your payout over time, mechanical pork which has you identify pictures of pigs for money to train an AI, write code freelance for startups for big payouts but long times, and other tasks.
